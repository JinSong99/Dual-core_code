# Dual-core_code

The visitors can download the package directly and use it in MATLAB.

Program pt_pu.m is used to calculate PT symmetry breaking. And Program eigg.m is to calculate eigenvalues.

Program MSOM_asym.m is to compute the numerical solutions including both symmetric and asymmetric ones.

Programs mu_Psym.m and mu_p_asym.m are to obtain the relationship between power P and propagation constant.

Program ssb_W0_j.m is to obtain the boundary of the breaking of the inter-core symmetry for symmetric and asymmetric modes.

Program ssb_theta.m is to obtain the asymmetry characteristic Î¸.

Programs evolution_j1.m and evolution_v0.m are used to obtain the numerically simulated evolution.
